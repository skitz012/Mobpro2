What we need to get done:

* Create 5 screens (Advisable, create 5 javascript files) called:
	* HomeScreen -- (X)
	* ViewContact -- TODO--
	* EditContact -- TODO--
	* AddContact -- TODO--
	* Settings

* Create a AddContact screen, make sure it can provide input for the user for:
	* Name
	* Department
	* Phone
	* Address

	And there is a save button that will call a fetch function and will use the HTTP method POST
		Make sure the endpoint is correct and the body field on the object is set correctly

	After a successful fetch call, use the navigation object to navigate back to HomeScreen
